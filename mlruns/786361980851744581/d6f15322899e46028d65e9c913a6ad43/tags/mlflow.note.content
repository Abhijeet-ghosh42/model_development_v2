### Run Documentation

**Deliverable**
- `winding_fault_configs_m257.yaml` — thresholds for winding-fault detection in real-time.

**Parameters**
- `tenant_id`: 28
- `machine_id`: 257

**Method**
- Thresholds computed as mean + 3.0σ over selected profiles.

**Metrics (for benchmarking)**
- `cur_imbalance_mean/std`: current phase imbalance stats.
- `vol_imbalance_mean/std`: voltage phase imbalance stats.
- `*_thresholds`: derived cutoffs for detection.
- `quality_index`: `(1 / (cur_std + vol_std)) * log1p(n_rows)`; higher is better.

**Decision Context**
- The YAML config is consumed by the serving-side detector.
- Metrics allow internal validation & run comparison.
- `quality_index` is suitable for automatic promotion.
